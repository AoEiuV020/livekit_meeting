A new Flutter module project.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the online
[documentation](https://flutter.dev/).

For instructions integrating Flutter modules to your existing applications,
see the [add-to-app documentation](https://flutter.dev/to/add-to-app).

### android
```shell
flutter build aar
```

### ios
```shell
flutter build ios-framework
```
> Error: The plugin "meeting_flutter" requires a higher minimum iOS deployment version than your application is targeting.
To build, increase your application's deployment target to at least 13.0 as described at https://flutter.dev/to/ios-deploy
Error running pod install

报错后手动编辑生成的.ios/Podfile，第一行指定最低版本13，
```
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

然后按这个改“objectVersion = 56”，

再pod init就成功了，虽然还有警告，但也只能无视了，
